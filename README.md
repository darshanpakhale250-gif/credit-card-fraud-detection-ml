# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** machine learning models.  
The dataset was taken from **Kaggle** and analyzed in **Google Colab**. Both `.ipynb` and `.py` versions are included for reference.

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Perform missing value analysis.
3. Analyze genuine vs fraudulent transactions.
4. Visualize transaction distribution using bar graphs.
5. Normalize the `Amount` column using **StandardScaler**.
6. Split the data (70:30 ratio) into train and test sets.
7. Train models:
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Random Forest Classifier
8. Compare model accuracy and performance metrics.
